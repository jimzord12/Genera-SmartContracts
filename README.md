## What is a Smart Contract?
A smart contract is a self-executing contract with terms of the agreement directly written into code. 
<br />
It automatically performs transactions when predefined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries.
<br /> 
It is typically built on blockchain technology, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency.
