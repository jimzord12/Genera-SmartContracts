GENERA Project: Web3 (Blockchain) Backend Logic

## What is a Smart Contract?

A smart contract is a self-executing contract with terms of the agreement directly written into code.
<br />
It automatically performs transactions when predefined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries.
<br />
It is typically built on blockchain technology, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency.
<br />

## Platform's Smart Contracts

Currently, our platform utilizes 2 Smart Contracts.

- RewardingTool.sol
- GameManager.sol

### RewardingTool

#### Contract Connection Data

- Address: 0x300302fEc3D905eb66Cb7743C636F8741B72dB3a
- Network: GENERA (Chain ID: 20231)
- ABI: [click here](https://github.com/jimzord12/Genera-SmartContracts/blob/main/rewardingABI.json)

#### Description

This Contract is tasked with the purpose of issuing and removing (burning) MGS (MyGreenScore) Tokens.
<br />
These tokens are used as way to motivate users to explore and utilize the platform's web services.
<br />
Users can accumulate these tokens by performing specific actions or tasks.

**_How to use the Contract_**
<br />

**_Step #1_**:
<br />
You have to insert/import a JavaScript Library in your Frontend that can interact with Blockchain Networks.
<br />
<br />
The most popular choices are:

- ethers.js
- web3.js

However, nowdays more abstract libraries exist that make this process event easier (ex. wagmi react hooks)
<br />
Once, this step is completed you should have a Contract instance that the library constructed based on the
<br />
address and ABI you provided as arguments.
<br />
<br />

**_Step #2_**:
<br />
Create a **Service** Object and its **Events** in the Smart Contract.
<br />
For example, a Service could be: "MOOC" and one of its Events could be: "videoWatched"
<br />

This step is a bit **tricky**, because it is not similar to how frontend development works.
<br />
This is because the Smart Contract's storage is not limited to only memory
<br />
(meaning that it will be erased when the user closes the browser tab or window).
<br />
Most of the time, we need to permanetly store information.
<br />
The easiest way to create these Service and Event objects is through the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org)
<br />

<br />

<br />

**_Step #3_**:
<br />
Finally, the only thing left to do is to call the contract's functions whenever you need them in your code, for example:
<br />

```javascript
function sumbitComment() {
    // Your previous code...
    // Supposing your Contract Instance name is "rewardContract"
    // This example uses ethers.js v5.7.2 syntax, but web3.js is very similar
    const { wasSuccessful } = await rewardContract.addPoints("MOOC", "videoWathced");
<br />
    if(!wasSuccessful) throw new Error("Contract Interaction Failed!")
    // The rest of your code...
}
```

<br />
