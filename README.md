GENERA Project: Web3 (Blockchain) Backend Logic


A smart contract is a self-executing contract with terms of the agreement directly written into code. It automatically performs transactions when predefined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries. It is typically built on blockchain technology, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency.
